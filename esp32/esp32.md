This Arduino code sets up an ESP32 device to communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and perform various file operations on an SD card, such as listing files, reading files, deleting files, and writing files. It also communicates with a BLE client to receive commands and send back responses accordingly.

Here's a brief overview of the code:

Includes necessary libraries for SD card and BLE functionalities.
Defines functions for performing file operations on the SD card: downloadCourse, listCourse, readCourseFile.
Defines functions for BLE setup and handling: setupBLE, MyServerCallbacks, MyCallbacks.
Defines utility functions for removing whitespace from strings.
Sets up the Arduino environment in the setup function, initializes BLE and SD card, and sets pins.
In the loop function, it continuously checks for incoming BLE messages or serial input.
It processes incoming BLE messages to perform file operations or responds to serial input by notifying BLE clients.
The code uses BLE notifications to send responses back to the BLE client.
The main functionalities include:

Listing files on the SD card.
Reading file contents from the SD card.
Deleting files from the SD card.
Writing data to new files on the SD card.
Ensure you have the necessary hardware (ESP32, SD card module, etc.) and libraries installed to run this code successfully. Additionally, you may need to modify the pin configurations and file paths according to your setup.
